WHAT IT DOES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  A lead-scoring and CRM workflow service that evaluates contact quality,
  writes back structured updates, and supports automated sales follow-up
  logic inside HubSpot.

  The agent receives lead and contact records from CRM-connected systems
  or workflow triggers, uses GPT-4o to assess fit, intent, and likelihood
  of sales progress, translates that evaluation into a structured scoring
  layer, and then writes the result back into HubSpot — updating scores,
  fields, follow-up metadata, and triggering downstream workflows.

  Primary benefit: automated lead triage without forcing sales reps to
  manually assess every incoming record. Use cases: lead routing,
  prioritization, enrichment, and nurture automation.

BACKEND WORKFLOW — 4 STEPS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Step 01 — Record intake
    Pulls or receives contact and lead records requiring evaluation.
    Loads profile attributes, engagement data, and business context.
    Builds the scoring input object for AI-assisted prioritization.
    → Input: Lead and contact records

  Step 02 — Lead evaluation
    Uses GPT-4o to assess fit, intent, and likelihood of sales progress.
    Translates contextual signals into a structured scoring layer.
    Determines whether the lead should be prioritized, nurtured, or
    routed differently.
    → Intermediate: Score + action recommendation

  Step 03 — Automation actioning
    Triggers updates, flags, and downstream follow-up workflows.
    Supports CRM enrichment and automated sales operations.
    Ensures output can be consumed by human reps or workflow engines.
    → Processing: Scoring → CRM workflow logic

  Step 04 — CRM writeback
    Updates scores, fields, and follow-up metadata on the HubSpot record.
    Keeps the CRM as the source of truth for sales execution.
    Returns a structured result confirming what changed.
    → Output: CRM updates + score state


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
OPERATIONAL ROLE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Bridges AI evaluation and CRM-native workflow execution. The scoring
  output is not just a number returned to a human — it becomes an
  operational input that drives real CRM actions and workflow decisions
  without manual intervention.
